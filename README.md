Experienced engineer with a passion for the inner workings of systems. I have background in devops, now work as a generalist. Care strongly about performance and simplicity. Observability, end-to-end-ownership, testing in prod.

Working at [Flip](https://github.com/flipgroup).

Also working on a Dark Souls / Elden Ring twitter bot - hopefully ready early 2022.

I'm a self-taught developer from a non-technical background. I've been working in tech since 2011.
