Experienced engineer with a passion for the inner workings of systems. I traverse the whole stack and care about the entire software lifecycle. I strongly believe that developers should truly own the systems they deliver from end to end.

Working at [Flip](https://github.com/flipgroup).

I'm a self-taught developer from a non-technical background. I've been working in tech since 2011.
