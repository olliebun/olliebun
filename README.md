Experienced software developer with a passion for the inner workings of systems. I have background in DevOps/Cloud/SRE, now work as a generalist. Care strongly about performance and simplicity. Observability, end-to-end-ownership, testing in prod.

Working with a great team at [Flip](https://github.com/flipgroup).

Love: #golang #git #linux #aws #sh #testinginproduction

Productively tolerate: #kubernetes #macos #android #java #python #ruby #php

Also working on a Dark Souls / Elden Ring twitter bot - hopefully ready early 2022.

I'm a self-taught developer from a non-technical background. I've been working in tech since 2011.
